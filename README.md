# Enterprise AI Accelerator - Day 2 - Part 2

## Model Context Protocol (MCP) ##

These instructions will guide you through configuring a GitHub Codespaces environment that you can use to do the labs. 

<br><br>

**1. Change your codespace's default timeout from 30 minutes to longer (60 suggested).**
To do this, when logged in to GitHub, go to https://github.com/settings/codespaces and scroll down on that page until you see the *Default idle timeout* section. Adjust the value as desired.

**2. Click on the button below to start a new codespace from this repository.**

Click here ➡️  [![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/skillrepos/aia-day2-b?quickstart=1)

<br><br>

**3. Then click on the option to create a new codespace.**

This will run for a long time while it gets everything ready.

After the initial startup, it will run a script to setup the python environment and install needed python pieces. This will take several more minutes to run. It will look like this while this is running.

The codespace is ready to use when you see a prompt like the one shown below in its terminal.

<br><br>

**4. Run setup script to finalize the installation.**

In the codespace *TERMINAL* panel at the bottom, run the following command.

```
scripts/setup.sh
```

This will setup the python environment, install needed python pieces, install Ollama, and then download the model we will use. This will take several more minutes to run.

<br><br>

**5. Open a new terminal.**

When the script is completed (after a long run), you can just click on the "+" sign on the far right to get a new terminal with the provided Python environment to work in.

<br><br>

**6. Open the labs file.**

You can open the [labs.md](./labs.md) file either in your codespace or in a separate browswer tab/instance.**

<br>

**Now, you are ready for the labs!**
